            <span class="objective-description">Our objective was to explore the use of Electron and the web technology stack for rapid, cross-platform application development. In this project, we successfully built a responsive client capable of communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP calls. Additionally, we developed a secure server application using Node.js and Express.<br/>Looking ahead, TechRAT engineers can leverage these technologies to efficiently create and deploy cross-platform applications.<br/><br/></span>
