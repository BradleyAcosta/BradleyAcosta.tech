        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Bradley Acosta Rojas</strong>, and I'm a dedicated <strong> Computer Science</strong> major with a passion for coding and teamwork. I thrive on organizing tasks efficiently and believe that every mistake is an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
        
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I have had the opportunity to work with <strong>TECHRAT LAB</strong>, where I honed my skills in Git/GitHub, JavaScript, and file management. During this time, <strong> I created an application using Node.js, NPM, HTML, CSS, and Electron</strong>. This project allowed me to focus on full stack development, responsive design, and web application security. 
          <em><strong>built a responsive client for server communication and a secure server using Node and Express</em></strong>. In addition to my experience in software development, I have developed a comprehensive set of IT Specialist skills in Systems Administration, including proficiency in operating systems like Windows and macOS, server management, network administration, security, backup and recovery, monitoring and performance tuning, user and access management, troubleshooting and support.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in some of my favorite hobbies: <em><strong>exercising, spend time with family and friends, playing video games, and watching anime. These activities help me stay balanced and energized.</strong></em></p>
        
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge. My goal is to secure a software engineering, web developer or full stack developer role, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow as a professional.</p>
